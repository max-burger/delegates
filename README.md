## Abstract
__Background:__ Many countries, such as Germany, struggle to vaccinate enough people against COVID-19 despite the availability of safe and efficient vaccines. With new variants emerging and the need for booster vaccinations, overcoming vaccination hesitancy gains importance. The research to date has unveiled some promising, albeit contentious, interventions to increase vaccination intentions. However, these have yet to be tested for their effectiveness in increasing vaccination rates. <br><br>
__Methods & Results:__ We conducted a preregistered survey experiment with N=1,324 participants in Germany in May/June 2021, which was followed by a series of emails reminding participants to get vaccinated in August and concluded by a follow-up survey in September. We experimentally assess whether debunking vaccination myths, highlighting the benefits of being vaccinated, or merely sending vaccination reminders decreases hesitancy. In the survey experiment, we find no increase in the intention to vaccinate regardless of the information provided. However, communicating vaccination benefits over several weeks reduced vaccination hesitancy, i.e., not being vaccinated, by 9 percentage points, which translates into a 27% reduction compared to the control group. Debunking vaccination myths and reminders alone also decreased hesitancy, yet not significantly.<br><br>
__Discussion:__ Our findings suggest that if soft governmental interventions such as information campaigns are employed, highlighting benefits should be given preference over debunking vaccination myths. Furthermore, it seems that repeated messages affect vaccination action while one-time messages might be insufficient, even for increasing vaccination intentions. Our study highlights the importance of testing interventions outside of survey experiments that are limited to measuring vaccination intentions – not actions – and immediate changes in attitudes and intentions – not long-term changes.
